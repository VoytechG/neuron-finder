### `tf.enable_eager_execution()`

Enables eager execution for the lifetime of this program.

Eager execution provides an imperative interface to TensorFlow. With eager execution enabled, TensorFlow functions execute operations immediately (as opposed to adding to a graph to be executed later in a tf.Session) and return concrete values (as opposed to symbolic references to a node in a computational graph).
